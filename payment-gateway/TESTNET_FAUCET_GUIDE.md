### Option 2: Alternative Testing (Without Real Funds)
You can test the system functionality without actual blockchain transactions:

- See QR codes and addresses
- Test dashboard features

---

## 📊 Recommended Testing Amounts

Once you get test funds:
```
Test 1: 10 USDT   - Basic payment flow
Test 2: 50 USDT   - Medium amount
Test 3: 5 USDT    - Small amount
Test 4: 100 USDT  - Large amount
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Save Test BNB**: Each transaction costs ~0.0005 BNB, so 0.5 BNB = ~1000 transactions
2. **Daily Limits**: Most faucets allow 1 request per 24 hours
3. **Multiple Wallets**: You can use multiple wallets if needed
4. **Swap on DEX**: Easiest way to get test USDT is swap BNB → USDT
5. **Keep Some BNB**: Always keep some BNB for gas fees
